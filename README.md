# ML-LAB
All the Programs of 6th Sem ML Lab with their output in different steps. These Programs include Find-S & Candidate-Elimination Algorithms, Supervised Learning & Unsupervised learning algorithms such as KNN, ANN, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes Classifier, Bayesian Networks, K-Means Clustering etc.

## Introduction to RTU Machine Learning Lab
The Rajasthan Technical University (RTU) Machine Learning Lab is designed to provide students with practical, hands-on experience in understanding and implementing core machine learning algorithms and concepts. This lab bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world applications by enabling students to design, develop, and evaluate machine learning models using programming languages like Java and Python.

### Objectives
- To familiarize students with various supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, neural networks, and classification techniques.
- To develop skills in implementing algorithms like FIND-S, Backpropagation, and others for pattern recognition and predictive analytics.
- To provide an environment to experiment with datasets, perform data preprocessing, and analyze model performance.
- To enable students to understand the practical challenges in machine learning including data handling, algorithm tuning, and evaluation metrics.

### Lab Structure and Experiments
The lab typically includes around 10 experiments covering:
- Implementation of decision tree algorithms for classification.
- Building and training artificial neural networks using backpropagation.
- Applying algorithms like FIND-S for hypothesis space learning.
- Data import/export and preprocessing using libraries such as pandas.
- Evaluation of classifiers using confusion matrix, accuracy, and classification reports.
Each experiment is designed to progressively build the student’s understanding of machine learning workflows, from data handling to model deployment.

### Hardware and Software Environment
- The lab is equipped with systems configured in dual boot mode (Windows and Linux) to provide flexibility in programming environments.
- Systems typically have Intel Pentium Dual Core processors, 2GB RAM, and 40GB hard disk space.
- Software tools include Java, Python, and relevant machine learning libraries.
- Each student is assigned a dedicated system to ensure consistent learning experience.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of the lab sessions, students will be able to:
- Implement and analyze various machine learning algorithms.
- Understand the theoretical foundations and practical applications of machine learning.
- Design solutions for real-world problems using machine learning techniques.
- Evaluate model performance and optimize algorithms for better accuracy.
- Gain confidence in using programming languages and tools for machine learning projects.

### Importance of the Lab
This lab plays a crucial role in preparing students for careers in data science, artificial intelligence, and software development by providing them with the essential skills to work with machine learning models and datasets effectively. It also encourages analytical thinking and problem-solving through experimental learning.

### RTU ML Lab Experiement:
**1.** Implement and demonstrate the FIND-Salgorithm for finding the most specific hypothesis based on a given set of training data samples. Read the training data from a .CSV file.

**2.** For a given set of training data examples stored in a .CSV file, implement and demonstrate the Candidate-Elimination algorithmto output a description of the set of all hypotheses consistent with the training examples.

**3.** Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3 algorithm. Use an appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge toclassify a new sample

**4.** Build an Artificial Neural Network by implementing the Backpropagation algorithm and test the same using appropriate data sets.

**5.** Write a program to implement the naïve Bayesian classifier for a sample training data set stored as a .CSV file. Compute the accuracy of the classifier, considering few test data sets.

**6.** Assuming a set of documents that need to be classified, use the naïve Bayesian Classifier model to perform this task. Built-in Java classes/API can be used to write the program. Calculate the accuracy, precision, and recall for your data set.

**7.** Write a program to construct aBayesian network considering medical data. Use this model to demonstrate the diagnosis of heart patients using standard Heart  Disease Data Set. You can use Java/Python ML library classes/API.

**8.** Apply EM algorithm to cluster a set of data stored in a .CSV file. Use the same data set for clustering using k-Means algorithm. Compare the results of these two algorithms and comment on the quality of clustering. You can add Java/Python ML library classes/API in the program.

**9.** Write a program to implement k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to classify the iris data set. Print both correct and wrong predictions. Java/Python ML library classes can be used for this problem.

**10.** Implement the non-parametric Locally Weighted Regression algorithm in order to fit data points. Select appropriate data set for your experiment and draw graphs.
