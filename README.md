## Introduction to RTU Machine Learning Lab
The Rajasthan Technical University (RTU) Machine Learning Lab is designed to provide students with practical, hands-on experience in understanding and implementing core machine learning algorithms and concepts. This lab bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world applications by enabling students to design, develop, and evaluate machine learning models using programming languages like Java and Python.

### Objectives
- To familiarize students with various supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, neural networks, and classification techniques.
- To develop skills in implementing algorithms like FIND-S, Backpropagation, and others for pattern recognition and predictive analytics.
- To provide an environment to experiment with datasets, perform data preprocessing, and analyze model performance.
- To enable students to understand the practical challenges in machine learning including data handling, algorithm tuning, and evaluation metrics.

### Lab Structure and Experiments
The lab typically includes around 10 experiments covering:
- Implementation of decision tree algorithms for classification.
- Building and training artificial neural networks using backpropagation.
- Applying algorithms like FIND-S for hypothesis space learning.
- Data import/export and preprocessing using libraries such as pandas.
- Evaluation of classifiers using confusion matrix, accuracy, and classification reports.
Each experiment is designed to progressively build the studentâ€™s understanding of machine learning workflows, from data handling to model deployment.

### Hardware and Software Environment
- The lab is equipped with systems configured in dual boot mode (Windows and Linux) to provide flexibility in programming environments.
- Systems typically have Intel Pentium Dual Core processors, 2GB RAM, and 40GB hard disk space.
- Software tools include Java, Python, and relevant machine learning libraries.
- Each student is assigned a dedicated system to ensure consistent learning experience.
